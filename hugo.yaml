    title: "About Me"
    image: /portfolio/baking.png
    content: |-
      I am a master’s student at Curtin University, majoring in computer science.
      Previously, I studied civil engineering at Xiangtan University.
      After graduating with my bachelor’s degree, I worked for CSCEC for over two years, gaining some experience in the construction industry, especially in project management and schedule control.
      Meanwhile, I worked remotely for Duolai Code. This experience has given me a diverse background that spans from engineering project management to software development.
      Currently, I’m an active open-source maintainer. I am committed to continuously contributing to the future of AI and open-source.
      I can work on multiple projects at the same time without getting stressed. After all, it’s something fun that I like to do which benefits other people. It also benefits the open-source community.
